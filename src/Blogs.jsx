      BLOGS <br />6 things to keep in mind before giving to laundry "Are you
      tired of picking up your clothes from the laundry only to find that
      they've shrunk, discolored, or been damaged in some other way? If so,
      you're not alone. Many people have had similar experiences, and it's often
      due to a lack of knowledge about what to do before giving their clothes to
      the laundry. In this blog, we'll share six things you should keep in mind
      before giving your clothes to the laundry to help ensure that they come
      back in the best possible condition. <br />
      1.) Read the Care Labels The care labels on your clothes are there for a
      reason. They provide important information about how to properly care for
      your clothes and help ensure that they don't get damaged in the laundry.
      Before giving your clothes to the laundry, take a few minutes to read the
      care labels and follow the instructions carefully.
      <br />
      2.) Sort Your Clothes Sorting your clothes by color and type of fabric is
      one of the most important things you can do before giving them to the
      laundry. This will help prevent dye transfer and protect delicate fabrics
      from getting damaged.
      <br />
      3.) Check for Stains Stains should be treated before giving your clothes
      to the laundry. This will help ensure that the stains don't set and become
      permanent. There are many different types of stains, so it's important to
      do a little research to determine the best way to treat each one.
      <br />
      4.) Button and Zip Up Before giving your clothes to the laundry, make sure
      that all buttons and zippers are securely fastened. This will help prevent
      damage during the washing and drying process.
      <br />
      5.) Turn Clothes Inside Out Turning your clothes inside out before giving
      them to the laundry can help reduce the amount of wear and tear that they
      experience. This is especially important for clothes that are prone to
      fading or have delicate embellishments.
      <br />
      6.) Use a Laundry Bag If you have delicate or expensive clothes, consider
      using a laundry bag. This will help protect the clothes from getting
      damaged in the washing machine and provide an extra layer of protection
      during the drying process. By following these six simple tips, you can
      help ensure that your clothes come back from the laundry looking their
      best. So, the next time you're getting ready to give your clothes to the
      laundry, take a moment to keep these things in mind, and you'll be well on
      your way to getting the best possible results."
